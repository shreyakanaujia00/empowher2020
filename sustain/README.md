# To set up
1. I cloned my directory to the local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/shreyakanaujia00/empowher2020

3. Checkout the code. 
```
git checkout

4. Check the status

5. Make changes locally on your laptop (using VSCode or something). Sometime when two people make changes, it will alert for a conflict, which we can resolve later.
6. Test it
7. Check the status, add files etc. and commit
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Changes maded for <something> for the app"
```
8. Update the origin, which is going to ask for your git id and password
```
git push --set-upstream origin
```
9. Pull file to local
```
git pull
```
10. Once finished editing, push file to origin
```
git push
```
